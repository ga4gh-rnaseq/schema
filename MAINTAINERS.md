## Updating the specification

Minor editorial fixes where there is no likelihood of controversy may be done directly on the **master** branch.
Larger changes should be proposed as pull requests so that they can be discussed and refined.
(Even those with write access to the **ga4gh-rnaseq/schema** repository should in general create their pull request branches within their own **schema** forks.
This way when the main repository is forked again, the new fork is created with a minimum of extraneous volatile branches.)
