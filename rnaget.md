# rnaget API

# Version: 1.0.0

## Design principles

This API provides a means of retrieving data from several types of RNA experiments including:

* Feature-level expression data from RNA-seq type measurements
* Coordinate-based signal/intensity data similar to a bigwig representation

via a client/server model.

Features of this API include:

* Support for a hierarchical data model which provides the option for servers to associate expression data for discovery and retrieval
* Support for accessing subsets of expression data through slicing operations on the expression matrix and/or query filters to specify features to be included
* Support for accessing signal/intensity data by specifying a range of genomic coordinates to be included

Out of the scope of this API are:

* A means of retrieving primary (raw) read sequence data. Input samples are identified in expression output and data servers should implement additional API(s) to allow for search and retrieval of raw reads. The [htsget API](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/htsget.html) is designed for retrieval of read data.
* A means of retrieving reference sequences. Each study lists the genomic reference used for alignment. Servers should implement additional API(s) to allow for search and retrieval of reference base sequences. The [rnaget API](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/rnaget.html) is designed for retrieval of references sequences.
* A means of retrieving feature annotation details. Expression matrices provide a means to link each mapped feature to the corresponding annotation. Servers should implement additional API(s) to allow for search and retrieval of genomic feature annotation details.

## OpenAPI Description

An OpenAPI description of this specification is available and [describes the 1.0.0 version](rnaget-openapi.yaml). OpenAPI is an independent API description format for describing REST services and is compatible with a number of [third party tools](http://openapi.tools/).

## Compliance

Implementors can check if their rnaget implementations conform to the specification by using our [compliance suite](https://github.com/ga4gh-rnaseq/rnaget-compliance-suite).

## Protocol essentials

All API invocations are made to a configurable HTTPS endpoint, receive URL-encoded query string parameters and HTTP headers, and return text or other allowed formatting as requested by the user. Successful requests result with HTTP status code 200 and have the appropriate text encoding in the response body as defined for each endpoint. The server may provide responses with chunked transfer encoding. The client and server may mutually negotiate HTTP/2 upgrade using the standard mechanism.

Requests adhering to this specification MAY include an Accept header specifying an alternative formatting of the response, if the server allows this. Otherwise the server shall return the default content type specified for the invoked method.

HTTP responses may be compressed using [RFC 2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html) transfer-coding, not content-coding.

HTTP response may include a 3XX response code and Location header redirecting the client to retrieve expression data from an alternate location as specified by [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231), clients SHOULD be configured to follow redirects. `302`, `303` and `307` are all valid response codes to use.

Requests MAY include an Accept header specifying the protocol version they are using:

```
Accept: application/vnd.ga4gh.rnaget.v1.0.0+json
```

Responses from the server MUST include a Content-Type header containing the encoding for the invoked method and protocol version:

```
Content-Type: application/vnd.ga4gh.rnaget.v1.0.0+json; charset=us-ascii
```

## Internet Media Types Handling

When responding to a request a server MUST use the fully specified media type for that endpoint. When determining if a request is well-formed, a server MUST allow a internet type to degrade like so

- `application/vnd.ga4gh.rnaget.v1.0.0+json; charset=us-ascii`
  - `application/vnd.ga4gh.rnaget.v1.0.0+json`
  - `application/json`

## Errors

The server MUST respond with an appropriate HTTP status code (4xx or 5xx) when an error condition is detected. In the case of transient server errors (e.g., 503 and other 5xx status codes), the client SHOULD implement appropriate retry logic. For example, if a client sends an alphanumeric string for a parameter that is specified as unsigned integer the server MUST reply with `Bad Request`.

| Error type        | HTTP status code | Description
|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| `Bad Request`     | 400 | Cannot process due to malformed request, the requested parameters do not adhere to the specification |
| `Unauthorized`    | 401 | Authorization provided is invalid |
| `Not Found`       | 404 | The resource requested was not found |
| `Not Acceptable`  | 406 | The requested formatting is not supported by the server |
| `Not Implemented` | 501 | The specified request is not supported by the server |

## Security

The rnaget API can be used to retrieve potentially sensitive genomic data and is dependent on the implementation.  Effective security measures are essential to protect the integrity and confidentiality of these data.

Sensitive information transmitted on public networks, such as access tokens and human genomic data, MUST be protected using Transport Level Security (TLS) version 1.2 or later, as specified in [RFC 5246](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246).

If the data holder requires client authentication and/or authorization, then the client's HTTPS API request MUST present an OAuth 2.0 bearer access token as specified in [RFC 6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750), in the Authorization request header field with the Bearer authentication scheme:

```
Authorization: Bearer [access_token]
```

Data providers SHOULD verify user identity and credentials.  The policies and processes used to perform user authentication and authorization, and the means through which access tokens are issued, are beyond the scope of this API specification. GA4GH recommends the use of the OAuth 2.0 framework ([RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)) for authentication and authorization.  It is also recommended that implementions of this standard also implement and follow the GA4GH [Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure (AAI) standard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zzsuNtbNY7agPRjfTe6gbWJ3BU6eX19JjWRKvkFg1ow).

## CORS
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is an essential technique used to overcome the same origin content policy seen in browsers. This policy restricts a webpage from making a request to another website and leaking potentially sensitive information. However the same origin policy is a barrier to using open APIs. GA4GH open API implementers should enable CORS to an acceptable level as defined by their internal policy. For any public API implementations should allow requests from any server.

GA4GH is publishing a [CORS best practices document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ifiik9afTO-CEpWGKEZ5TlixQ6tiKcvug4XLd9GNcqo/edit?usp=sharing), which implementers should refer to for guidance when enabling CORS on public API instances.

## Responsible data sharing

The GA4GH promotes secure, federated and ethical approaches to data sharing.  For a discussion of the nature of RNA expression data, the importance of sharing expression data and some of the privacy considerations to be aware of please refer to the [Ethics Toolkit for Sharing Gene Expression Data from RNA Sequencing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QeiYFkJDE81Bdl88LEYH0R6fQ-BgOQiKz0-dqaZqeWE).

## API Methods

This section lists the recommended URL endpoints a server SHOULD implement in order to navigate the RNA-seq data hierarchy and allow retrieval of expression data.

Endpoints are described as HTTPS GET methods which will be sufficient for most queries.  Queries containing multiple metadata filters may approach or exceed the URL length limits.  To handle these types of queries it is recommended that servers SHOULD implement parallel HTTPS POST endpoints accepting the same URL parameters as a UTF8-encoded JSON key-value dictionary.

When processing requests containing multiple filters, the data provider SHOULD use a logical `AND` for selecting the results to return.

### Project: Get project by id

The project is the top level of the model hierarchy and contains a set of related studies.  Example projects include:

* all data submitted by contributor X
* the local mirror of the European Nucleotide Archive data

  "studyID": "6cccbbd76b9c4837bd7342dd616d0fec",
  "units": "TPM"
}
```

### Expression: Get supported data formats

The recommended search endpoint is:

`GET /expressions/formats`

The response is a list of the supported data formats as a JSON formatted object unless an alternative formatting supported by the server is requested.  A data provider may use any internal storage format that they wish with no restrictions from this API.  To support development of interoperable clients, it is recommended that data providers MUST support at least 1 of the following common output formats:

  * Tab delimited text (.tsv)
  * [Loom](https://linnarssonlab.org/loompy/format/index.html) (.loom)

A Tab delimited file can have any number of comment lines beginning with `#` for storing metadata.  There should be one header row following the comments.  Feature (genes/transcripts) names and/or ID fields should be the first columns of the header row and have the `string` type.  All following columns are for the samples and will have 32-bit `float` values in each row.

##### Example .tsv file

```
# Example tsv file
geneID	geneName	sample1	sample2
ENSG00000000003	TSPAN6	12.4	15.6
```

A Loom format file will have a 32-bit `float` matrix for the expression values with samples on the column axis and features on the row axis.  Associated metadata can be stored as row and column attributes as described by loom specification.

##### The meaning of zero

Microarray and image-based RNA-seq (Seq-FISH etc.) have a dependency on probes which may not have 100% coverage of the annotation reference.  The consequence is that some features which show zero expression may not necessarily have a truly zero expression.  This idea can be extended further in the context of submitted data as well as potentially access restricted data.  The result is that a zero value can indicate one of several states:

1. _Not measured_ – not measured at all and value is not available
2. _Not supplied_ – measured but not provided to the data repository
3. _Restricted access_ – measured but require further authentication to view
4. _Not applicable_ – measurement does not apply to the sample

If practical a data provider SHOULD adopt a means to indicate these states rather than use a zero.  It is recommended that the `NaN` value be used to indicate these states.

GET /expressions/formats
["tsv", "loom"]
```

### Expression: Search for matching RNA expressions

The recommended search endpoint is:

`GET /expressions/search`

To support queries with many parameters the data provider SHOULD implement the following POST endpoint:

    POST /expressions/search

accepting a UTF-8 JSON encoded key-value dictionary in the form:
```
{
  "filter1": "value1",
  "filter2": "value2"
}
```

in which each `filter#` key matches the corresponding URL parameter.  The reponse is a list of matching expressions in JSON format unless an alternative formatting supported by the server is requested.

##### Default encoding
Unless negotiated with the client and allowed by the server, the default encoding for this method is:

```
Content-type: application/vnd.ga4gh.rnaget.v1.0.0+json
```

#### URL parameters

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Description
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| `format`  | string    | Yes      | Data format to return.  MUST be one of the supported data types returned by a request to the `/expressions/formats` endpoint |

  }
]
```

#### Expression Threshold

To allow for filtering on a range of expression values for multiple features the `/expressions/search` endpoint optionally accepts an array of `threshold` object.  This is a JSON formatted object with the following fields.

| Data Field         | Data Type | Required | Description
|--------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| `threshold`        | 32-bit float | Yes      | Numeric value to compare to expression value when filtering |

| `featureName`      | string    | Optional | Name of feature this threshold corresponds to |
| `featureAccession` | string    | Optional | Accession of feature this threshold corresponds to |

For each threshold tuple the request SHOULD provide only one of `featureID`, `featureName` or `featureAccession`.  If none of these are provided the query will return all samples containing 1 or more features satisfying the `threshold` value and condition (min or max).

#### Sample `threshold`

{
  "threshold": 10,
  "featureName": "GABARAPL2"
}

#### Expression: Get available search filters

### Continuous: Get signal values by id

The continuous object is a matrix of numeric signal values.  Continuous requests return this numeric matrix as a file attachment.

`GET /continuous/<id>`

The primary method for accessing specific continuous value data.  The reponse is the specified continuous matrix as a downloadable attachment.

If the server will not be providing numeric signal matrix data it MUST still define the `/continuous` endpoint and MUST respond with an `Not Implemented` error to requests sent to this endpoint.

##### Default encoding
Unless negotiated with the client and allowed by the server, the default encoding for this method is:

For loom files:
```
Content-type: application/vnd.loom
Content-Disposition: attachment
```

For tsv files:
```
Content-type: text/tab-separated-values
Content-Disposition: attachment
```

#### URL parameters

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Description 
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| `id`      | string    | Yes      | A string identifying which record to return.  The format of this identifier is left to the discretion of the API provider, including allowing embedded "/" characters. The following would be valid identifiers: some-continuousId or /byContributor/some-continuousId |

#### Request parameters

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Description 
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| `Accept`  | string    | Optional | The formatting of the returned continuous object, defaults to `application/vnd.loom` if not specified. A server MAY support other formatting. The server SHOULD respond with an `Not Acceptable` error if the client requests a format not supported by the server.|

#### Response

The server shall return the selected continuous matrix as a downloadable attachment.

On success and a continuous object is returned the server MUST issue a 200 status code.

#### An example response

```
200 OK
Content-type: application/vnd.loom
Content-Disposition: attachment

<matrix file as response body>
```

### Continuous: Get supported data formats

The recommended endpoint is:

`GET /continuous/formats`

The response is a list of the supported data formats as a JSON formatted object unless an alternative formatting supported by the server is requested.  A data provider may use any internal storage format that they wish with no restrictions from this API.  To support development of interoperable clients, it is recommended that data providers MUST support at least 1 of the following common output formats:

  * Tab delimited text (.tsv)
  * [Loom](https://linnarssonlab.org/loompy/format/index.html) (.loom)

A Tab delimited file can have any number of comment lines beginning with `#` for storing metadata.  The first line of the tsv file will be a tab-delimited list beginning with `#labels` and containing the labels for text fields in the main matrix.  The second line of the tsv file will be a tab-delimited list containing 2 items: `#range` and the range in the form chr?:start-stop where the start coordinate is zero-based, inclusive and the stop coordinate is zero-based, exclusive.  Any additonal comments may follow these 2 lines.  The data matrix follows the comment black.  Sample names and/or ID fields should be the first columns of the header row, be in the same order as listed in the `#labels` comment  and have the `string` type.  All coordinates in the continuous range described in the `#range` comment will be in the following columns with each base position in its own column.  The coordinate columns will contain 32-bit `float` values in each row corresponding to the measured signal value at that coordiante for the sample correponding to that row.

##### Example .tsv file

```
#labels	sampleID	sampleName
#range	chr1:1000000-1000002
# assembly	GRCh38-V29-male
12003-L1	12003-human-liver-4	12.4	15.6
```

A Loom format file will have a 32-bit `float` matrix for the signal values with coordinates on the column axis and samples on the row axis.  Associated metadata can be stored as row and column attributes as described by the loom specification.

##### Default encoding
Unless negotiated with the client and allowed by the server, the default encoding for this method is:

```
Content-type: application/vnd.ga4gh.rnaget.v1.0.0+json
```

#### Request parameters

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Description 
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| `Accept`  | string    | Optional | The formatting of the returned formats, defaults to `application/vnd.ga4gh.rnaget.v1.0.0+json` if not specified. A server MAY support other formatting. The server SHOULD respond with an `Not Acceptable` error if the client requests a format not supported by the server.|

#### Response

The server shall return the supported formats as JSON formatted string array.  The server may return the list in an alternative formatting, such as plain text, if requested by the client via the `Accept` header and the format is supported by the server.

On success and a list is returned the server MUST issue a 200 status code.

#### An example response

```
GET /expressions/formats
["tsv", "loom"]
```

}
```

in which each `filter#` key matches the corresponding URL parameter.  The reponse is a continuous object in JSON format unless an alternative formatting supported by the server is requested.

##### Default encoding
Unless negotiated with the client and allowed by the server, the default encoding for this method is:

```
Content-type: application/vnd.ga4gh.rnaget.v1.0.0+json
