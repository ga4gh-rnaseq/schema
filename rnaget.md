# rnaget API

# Version: 1.0.0

# Design principles

This API provides a means of retrieving RNA-seq expression data via a client/server model.

Features of this API include:

* A matrix representation for expression data to allow for efficient retrieval of large numbers of results
* Support for a hierarchical data model which provides the option for servers to associate expression data for discovery and retrieval
* Support for accessing subsets of expression data through slicing operations on the expression matrix and/or query filters to specify features to be included

Out of the scope of this API are:

* A means of retrieving primary (raw) read sequence data.  Expression matrices provide a means to link each included sample to the corresponding input read sequences and servers should implement additional API(s) to allow for search and retrieval of raw reads.
* A means of retrieving reference sequences.  Expression matrices provide a means to link each included sample to the genomic reference used for alignment.  Servers should implement additional API(s) to allow for search and retrieval of reference base sequences.
* A means of retrieving feature annotation details.  Expression matrices provide a means to link each mapped feature to the corresponding annotation.  Servers should implement additional API(s) to allow for search and retrieval of genomic feature annotation details.

# Protocol essentials

All API invocations are made to a configurable HTTPS endpoint, receive URL-encoded query string parameters, and return JSON output. Successful requests result with HTTP status code 200 and have UTF8-encoded JSON in the response body. The server may provide responses with chunked transfer encoding. The client and server may mutually negotiate HTTP/2 upgrade using the standard mechanism.

# Errors

The server MUST respond with an appropriate HTTP status code (4xx or 5xx) when an error condition is detected.

# Request

This section lists the recommended URL endpoints a server SHOULD implement in order to navigate the RNA-seq data hierarchy and allow retrieval of expression data.

Endpoints are described as HTTPS GET methods which will be sufficient for most queries.  Queries containing multiple metadata filters may approach or exceed the URL length limits.  To handles these types of queries it is recommended that servers SHOULD implement parallel HTTPS POST endpoints accepting the same URL parameters as UTF8-encoded JSON.

When processing requests containing multiple filters, the data provider SHOULD use a logical `AND` for selecting the results to return.
